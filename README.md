# Online Grocery Store 2.0

# Directions for Cloning:
1. Open the terminal application on your computer. (You can search for this in your applications. It is typically in Utilities.)
2. The terminal will open at the top level of your computer. To specify where you want the Howes-Grocery repository or "folder" to exist, do the following:
  a. Type "ls" and then press enter. "ls" stands for list stuff. This will display the folders/directories that exist at the top level of your computer (i.e. Applications, Books, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.)
  b. Type "cd Documents" and then press enter. "cd" stands for change directory. Your terminal will now have you in your Documents folder.
  c. Type "mkdir GroceryStore" and then press enter. "mkdir" stands for make directory. Note: you can change the GroceryStore to be any name you would like it to be i.e. howes-grocery, HowesGroceryStore, etc. but it cannot include spaces.
  d. Type "cd GroceryStore" (or whatever you have named the folder you just made) and then press enter. You are now in your newly made folder.
3. Clone the repository by doing the following:
  a. Copy the repository link: https://github.com/howesgrocery/howes-grocery.git from the main repository page (to copy the link press the clone or download button and you can then press the copy button that looks like a clipboard).
  b. In the terminal window type "git clone " and then paste the link.
