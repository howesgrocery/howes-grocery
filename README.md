# Online Grocery Store 2.0

# Directions for Downloading:
1. Create a folder on your computer in which you want to store the Howes Grocery Story Project. Be sure that the folder name has no spaces i.e. howes-grocery, HowesGroceryStore, etc. For the instructions we will use the folder name "GroceryStore". (For the easiest way to follow the instructions below, create the folder in your Documents folder).
2. Download the Howes Grocery Store repository/folder from the main repository page and then move it into the folder you have created (ie GroceryStore).
3. Open the terminal application on your computer. (You can search for this in your applications. It is typically in Utilities.)
4. The terminal will open at the top level of your computer. Next, navigate to the downloaded howes-grocery-master folder. To do this, do the following:

  a) Type "cd Documents" and then press enter. "cd" stands for change directory. Your terminal will now have you in your Documents folder.
  
  b) Type "cd GroceryStore" (or whatever you named the folder from step 1) and then press enter. Your terminal will now have you in your GroceryStore folder.
  
  c) Type "cd howes-grocery-master" and then press enter. Your terminal will now have you in your howes-grocery-master folder.
5. Download node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. You can likely download the "recommended for most users" version.
6. Once the node.js software has been downloaded, return to the terminal window and type "npm install" and then press enter. This will install any necessary packages.
7. Then, again in the terminal window, type "npm run build" and then press enter.
8. Then, again in the terminal window, type "sudo node build/index.js" and then press enter.
9. The terminal will ask you for your computer password. Note: It will not show when you have entered a key, however, if you are typing your password, it is being entered. This is for added security i.e. no one would be able to see how long your password is.
10. Open a new browser window (i.e. Google Chrome) and type localhost.
11. The page will open and ask you for your ID. Click right above the submit button and you can type anythign (for now) before pressing submit.
12. You are now running a local version of the Grocery Store!
